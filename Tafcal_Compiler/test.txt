/*

This Compiler is Made by Syed Mustafa Imam. As the final Project of Compiler Construction course given by Sir Khawaja.
I have named my compiler 'TAFCAL' as 'TAF' is my nick Name and 'CAL' is for Compiler.
My compiler for TAFCAL language, which is defined by Sir Khawaja, it can recognize lexeme and  it will
decide that the lexeme should go into the symbol table or not.It also assigns the token type and 
attributes value to each token. This TAFCAL Compiler can also find some basic Errors.It can also extract
the values from the SLR(1) parse table and also from the given CFG.
***
The keywords for this language are:
begin, end, if, then, else, int, float, char, string.
